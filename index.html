<h1>History of Arsenal<h1/>	
    
<h2 id="history">   
    Arsenal was formed in 1886 by a group of workers at a factory in Woolwich, and the club was first known as Dial Square. The name was soon changed to Royal Arsenal, though when the club turned professional in 1891 the name changed again to Woolwich Arsenal. The prefix was later dropped and the club became Arsenal Football Club. For a period it was popularly known as The Arsenal though this was never the club's name.
<br><br>
Arsenal was elected to the 2nd division of the Football League in 1893, and gained promotion to the 1st division in 1904. Arsenal survived in the first division for nine years, and in 1909 when a 6th place finish in the league was achieved.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, relegation followed in 1913, but coincided with a major landmark in the club's history. Having played for the 27 years at various sites in   South London, the club moved to its present site at Arsenal Stadium, North London. It almost paid off in the following season when Arsenal missed out on promotion only on goal average, and 5th place was achieved in 1915 before the 1st World War.
<br><br>
Promotion back to the 1st division was lead by Sir Henry when the Football League resumed in 1919, and Arsenal has not been relegated since, holding the record for longest time not being relegated the top division of English football. 
<br><br>
The following few seasons saw the club maintain a high standard to remaining in the 1st division, but insufficient to progress. However, after narrowly avoiding relegation in 1925, another turning point in Arsenal's fortunes was reached. The legendary Herbert Chapman was appointed manager and over the next 9 years transformed Arsenal from an average first division club into one of the great names in world football.
<br><br>
The visionary Chapman introduced the now famous white sleeves and pioneered the use of shirt numbers. Under his guidance Arsenal gradually progressed in the late twenties, coming 2nd in the league in 1926 and reaching the Cup final in 1927. The club went on to dominate English football over the following decade. The FA Cup became Arsenal's first major trophy in 1930, and the first league championship in 1931 was followed by a further 4 titles and another FA Cup over the next 7 years.
<br><br>
1937-38 brought Arsenal's 5th league title in seven years, though the near invincible team which had dominated the decade was generally held to be in decline. After the interruption caused by the 2nd World War, Tom Whittaker forged another great team, and 2 more titles (1947-48 and 1952-53) and an FA Cup (1950) were won over a 5 year period, with the 1951-52 season also seeing the Gunners narrowly miss the elusive double, runners up in both league and FA cup.
<br><br>
Whittaker's death in 1956 marked a decline in fortunes of the great club, and a disappointing 14 years followed.
<br><br>
Alot of hardwork and deication saw the club back to its bestby  the 1970's
<br><br>  
Despite reaching the FA cup final in 1972 and finishing second in the league the following season, and Arsenal became a mid-table team once again during the mid seventies. Towards the end of the decade however, under Terry Neill and Don Howe, some success returned when Arsenal set another record, reaching the FA Cup final in 3 successive seasons. Only the middle visit to Wembley, in 1979, was triumphant, a thrilling last minute 3-2 victory against Manchester United. The following season saw cup heartbreak when Arsenal lost the FA Cup final to West Ham, and 4 days later the European Cup Winners Cup final to Valencia on penalties.
<br><br>
Success became more habitual once again during the George Graham era. After Graham took over in 1986, Arsenal won six major trophies in the next eight years. A League Cup triumph in 1987 was built upon, and in 1989 the league championship returned to Highbury after an 18 year absence when Arsenal beat Liverpool to the title on goals scored. In the most exciting finish to the league season ever, the final, deciding match at Anfield was won 2-0 with a last minute sealer by Michael Thomas. Another championship followed two years later when Arsenal lost only one league game and conceded just 18 goals in 38 matches.
<br><br>
In the Premiership's inaugural year 1992-93, still under Graham's stern control, Arsenal again made history by becoming the first team ever to win both domestic cups in the same season, Sheffield Wednesday the unfortunate victims on both occasions. Arsenal came from behind to win the Coca Cola Cup 2-1, and eventually also won the FA Cup, winning the replay by the same score with a last minute extra time winner from Andy Linighan. 
<br><br>
However, despite the cup successes with what at the time was regarded as an ageing team, Arsenal's league results during the first 3 years of the Premiership were distinctly ordinary, and following the Rune Hauge bung affair Graham was disgraced and sacked in the middle of the 94-95 season. Under the temporary stewardship of Stewart Houston, Arsenal did manage to reach the Cup Winners Cup final for the 2nd successive year, but lost in the final seconds of extra time to the Spanish team, Real Zaragoza.
<br><br>
The period 1995-1997 turned out to be transitional and somewhat turbulent. Bruce Rioch was installed as manager in June 1995, but after guiding Arsenal to UEFA Cup qualification with a 5th place finish in the league and significantly signing Dennis Bergkamp, he was  sacked in August 1996 just days before the new season was due to begin. Eventually the Frenchman Arsene Wenger was confirmed as Arsenal's new manager at the end of September. He quickly impressed the Arsenal faithful by the calm and assured way he took control, and without making any major change took Arsenal to 3rd in the league, and qualification for the UEFA Cup again, by the end of the season.
<br><br>
The following season, 1997-98, he made history by winning the double for the second time. With some close season signings from he revitalised the team, apart from the astonishing defence. The new faces took time to get in, and the early part of the season reached a low point with a UEFA Cup 1st round exit
<br><br>
The team almost performed similar heroics the following season, but this time fell just short, losing unluckily in FA Cup semi-final extra time to Manchester United, and missing out on the title to the same  rivals by just one point.
